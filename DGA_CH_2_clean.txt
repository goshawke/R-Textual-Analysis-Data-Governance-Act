on european data governance data governance act
text with eea relevance
the european parliament and the council of the european union
having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article thereof
having regard to the proposal from the european commission
after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments
having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 
having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions 
acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure
whereas
the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeuâ€™ provides for the establishment of an internal market and the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the internal market is not distorted the establishment of common rules and practices in the member states relating to the development of a framework for data governance should contribute to the achievement of those objectives
over the last few years digital technologies have transformed the economy and society affecting all sectors of activity and daily life data is at the centre of this transformation data-driven innovation will bring enormous benefits for citizens for example through improved personalised medicine new mobility and its contribution to the european green deal  in its data strategy  the commission described the vision of a common european data space a single market for data in which data could be used irrespective of its physical location of storage in the union in compliance with applicable law it also called for the free and safe flow of data with third countries subject to exceptions and restrictions for public security public order and other legitimate public policy objectives of the european union in line with international obligations in order to turn that vision into reality it proposes to establish domain-specific common european data spaces as the concrete arrangements in which data sharing and data pooling can happen as foreseen in that strategy such common european data spaces can cover areas such as health mobility manufacturing financial services energy or agriculture or thematic areas such as the european green deal or european data spaces for public administration or skills
it is necessary to improve the conditions for data sharing in the internal market by creating a harmonised framework for data exchanges sector-specific legislation can develop adapt and propose new and complementary elements depending on the specificities of the sector such as the envisaged legislation on the european health data space and on access to vehicle data moreover certain sectors of the economy are already regulated by sector-specific union law that include rules relating to cross-border or union wide sharing or access to data  this regulation is therefore without prejudice to regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council  and in particular the implementation of this regulation shall not prevent cross border transfers of data in accordance with chapter v of regulation eu from taking place directive eu of the european parliament and of the council  directive eu of the european parliament and of the council  regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council  regulation ec no of the european parliament and of the council  directive ec of the european parliament and of the council  directive ec of the european parliament and of the council  directive eu of the european parliament and of the council  directive ec of the european parliament and of the council  directive eu of the european parliament and of the council  as well as regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council  directive eu of the european parliament and of the council  and delegated regulations adopted on its basis and any other sector-specific union legislation that organises the access to and re-use of data this regulation should be without prejudice to the access and use of data for the purpose of international cooperation in the context of prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties a horizontal regime for the re-use of certain categories of protected data held by public sector bodies the provision of data sharing services and of services based on data altruism in the union should be established specific characteristics of different sectors may require the design of sectoral data-based systems while building on the requirements of this regulation where a sector-specific union legal act requires public sector bodies providers of data sharing services or registered entities providing data altruism services to comply with specific additional technical administrative or organisational requirements including through an authorisation or certification regime those provisions of that sector-specific union legal act should also apply
action at union level is necessary in order to address the barriers to a well-functioning data-driven economy and to create a union-wide governance framework for data access and use in particular regarding the re-use of certain types of data held by the public sector the provision of services by data sharing providers to business users and to data subjects as well as the collection and processing of data made available for altruistic purposes by natural and legal persons
the idea that data that has been generated at the expense of public budgets should benefit society has been part of union policy for a long time directive eu as well as sector-specific legislation ensure that the public sector makes more of the data it produces easily available for use and re-use however certain categories of data commercially confidential data data subject to statistical confidentiality data protected by intellectual property rights of third parties including trade secrets and personal data not accessible on the basis of specific national or union legislation such as regulation eu and directive eu in public databases is often not made available not even for research or innovative activities due to the sensitivity of this data certain technical and legal procedural requirements must be met before they are made available in order to ensure the respect of rights others have over such data such requirements are usually time- and knowledge-intensive to fulfil this has led to the underutilisation of such data while some member states are setting up structures processes and sometimes legislate to facilitate this type of re-use this is not the case across the union
there are techniques enabling privacy-friendly analyses on databases that contain personal data such as anonymisation pseudonymisation differential privacy generalisation or suppression and randomisation application of these privacy-enhancing technologies together with comprehensive data protection approaches should ensure the safe re-use of personal data and commercially confidential business data for research innovation and statistical purposes in many cases this implies that the data use and re-use in this context can only be done in a secure processing environment set in place and supervised by the public sector there is experience at union level with such secure processing environments that are used for research on statistical microdata on the basis of commission regulation eu   in general insofar as personal data are concerned the processing of personal data should rely upon one or more of the grounds for processing provided in article of regulation eu 
the categories of data held by public sector bodies which should be subject to re-use under this regulation fall outside the scope of directive eu that excludes data which is not accessible due to commercial and statistical confidentiality and data for which third parties have intellectual property rights personal data fall outside the scope of directive eu insofar as the access regime excludes or restricts access to such data for reasons of data protection privacy and the integrity of the individual in particular in accordance with data protection rules the re-use of data which may contain trade secrets should take place without prejudice to directive eu  which sets the framework for the lawful acquisition use or disclosure of trade secrets this regulation is without prejudice and complementary to more specific obligations on public sector bodies to allow re-use of data laid down in sector-specific union or national law
the re-use regime provided for in this regulation should apply to data the supply of which forms part of the public tasks of the public sector bodies concerned as defined by law or by other binding rules in the member states in the absence of such rules the public tasks should be defined in accordance with common administrative practice in the member states provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review the public tasks could be defined generally or on a case-by-case basis for individual public sector bodies as public undertakings are not covered by the definition of public sector body the data they hold should not be subject to this regulation data held by cultural and educational establishments for which intellectual property rights are not incidental but which are predominantly contained in works and other documents protected by such intellectual property rights are not covered by this regulation
public sector bodies should comply with competition law when establishing the principles for re-use of data they hold avoiding as far as possible the conclusion of agreements which might have as their objective or effect the creation of exclusive rights for the re-use of certain data such agreement should be only possible when justified and necessary for the provision of a service of general interest this may be the case when exclusive use of the data is the only way to maximise the societal benefits of the data in question for example where there is only one entity which has specialised in the processing of a specific dataset capable of delivering the service or the product which allows the public sector body to provide an advanced digital service in the general interest such arrangements should however be concluded in compliance with public procurement rules and be subject to regular review based on a market analysis in order to ascertain whether such exclusivity continues to be necessary in addition such arrangements should comply with the relevant state aid rules as appropriate and should be concluded for a limited period which should not exceed three years in order to ensure transparency such exclusive agreements should be published online regardless of a possible publication of an award of a public procurement contract 
prohibited exclusive agreements and other practices or arrangements between data holders and data re-users which do not expressly grant exclusive rights but which can reasonably be expected to restrict the availability of data for re-use that have been concluded or have been already in place before the entry into force of this regulation should not be renewed after the expiration of their term in the case of indefinite or longer-term agreements they should be terminated within three years from the date of entry into force of this regulation
conditions for re-use of protected data that apply to public sector bodies competent under national law to allow re-use and which should be without prejudice to rights or obligations concerning access to such data should be laid down those conditions should be non-discriminatory proportionate and objectively justified while not restricting competition in particular public sector bodies allowing re-use should have in place the technical means necessary to ensure the protection of rights and interests of third parties conditions attached to the re-use of data should be limited to what is necessary to preserve the rights and interests of others in the data and the integrity of the information technology and communication systems of the public sector bodies public sector bodies should apply conditions which best serve the interests of the re-user without leading to a disproportionate effort for the public sector depending on the case at hand before its transmission personal data should be fully anonymised so as to definitively not allow the identification of the data subjects or data containing commercially confidential information modified in such a way that no confidential information is disclosed where provision of anonymised or modified data would not respond to the needs of the re-user on-premise or remote re-use of the data within a secure processing environment could be permitted data analyses in such secure processing environments should be supervised by the public sector body so as to protect the rights and interests of others in particular personal data should only be transmitted for re-use to a third party where a legal basis allows such transmission the public sector body could make the use of such secure processing environment conditional on the signature by the re-user of a confidentiality agreement that prohibits the disclosure of any information that jeopardises the rights and interests of third parties that the re-user may have acquired despite the safeguards put in place the public sector bodies where relevant should facilitate the re-use of data on the basis of consent of data subjects or permissions of legal persons on the re-use of data pertaining to them through adequate technical means in this respect the public sector body should support potential re-users in seeking such consent by establishing technical mechanisms that permit transmitting requests for consent from re-users where practically feasible no contact information should be given that allows re-users to contact data subjects or companies directly
the intellectual property rights of third parties should not be affected by this regulation this regulation should neither affect the existence or ownership of intellectual property rights of public sector bodies nor should it limit the exercise of these rights in any way beyond the boundaries set by this regulation the obligations imposed in accordance with this regulation should apply only insofar as they are compatible with international agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights in particular the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works berne convention the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement and the wipo copyright treaty wct public sector bodies should however exercise their copyright in a way that facilitates re-use
data subject to intellectual property rights as well as trade secrets should only be transmitted to a third party where such transmission is lawful by virtue of union or national law or with the agreement of the rightholder where public sector bodies are holders of the right provided for in article of directive ec of the european parliament and of the council  they should not exercise that right in order to prevent the re-use of data or to restrict re-use beyond the limits set by this regulation
companies and data subjects should be able to trust that the re-use of certain categories of protected data which are held by the public sector will take place in a manner that respects their rights and interests additional safeguards should thus be put in place for situations in which the re-use of such public sector data is taking place on the basis of a processing of the data outside the public sector such an additional safeguard could be found in the requirement that public sector bodies should take fully into account the rights and interests of natural and legal persons in particular the protection of personal data commercially sensitive data and the protection of intellectual property rights in case such data is transferred to third countries
furthermore it is important to protect commercially sensitive data of non-personal nature notably trade secrets but also non-personal data representing content protected by intellectual property rights from unlawful access that may lead to ip theft or industrial espionage in order to ensure the protection of fundamental rights or interests of data holders non-personal data which is to be protected from unlawful or unauthorised access under union or national law and which is held by public sector bodies should be transferred only to third-countries where appropriate safeguards for the use of data are provided such appropriate safeguards should be considered to exist when in that third-country there are equivalent measures in place which ensure that non-personal data benefits from a level of protection similar to that applicable by means of union or national law in particular as regards the protection of trade secrets and the protection of intellectual property rights to that end the commission may adopt implementing acts that declare that a third country provides a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to those provided by union or national law the assessment of the level of protection afforded in such third-country should in particular take into consideration the relevant legislation both general and sectoral including concerning public security defence national security and criminal law concerning the access to and protection of non-personal data any access by the public authorities of that third country to the data transferred the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the legal regime ensuring access to such data or the third countriesâ€™ international commitments regarding the protection of data the third country concerned has entered into or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems the existence of effective legal remedies for data holders public sector bodies or data sharing providers in the third country concerned is of particular importance in the context of the transfer of non-personal data to that third country such safeguards should therefore include the availability of enforceable rights and of effective legal remedies
in cases where there is no implementing act adopted by the commission in relation to a third country declaring that it provides a level of protection in particular as regards the protection of commercially sensitive data and the protection of intellectual property rights which is essentially equivalent to that provided by union or national law the public sector body should only transmit protected data to a re-user if the re-user undertakes obligations in the interest of the protection of the data the re-user that intends to transfer the data to such third country should commit to comply with the obligations laid out in this regulation even after the data has been transferred to the third country to ensure the proper enforcement of such obligations the re-user should also accept the jurisdiction of the member state of the public sector body that allowed the re-use for the judicial settlement of disputes
some third countries adopt laws regulations and other legal acts which aim at directly transferring or providing access to non-personal data in the union under the control of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the member states judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring such transfer or access to non-personal data should be enforceable when based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the union or a member state in some cases situations may arise where the obligation to transfer or provide access to non-personal data arising from a third country law conflicts with a competing obligation to protect such data under union or national law in particular as regards the protection of commercially sensitive data and the protection of intellectual property rights and including its contractual undertakings regarding confidentiality in accordance with such law in the absence of international agreements regulating such matters transfer or access should only be allowed under certain conditions in particular that the third-country system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out that the court order or the decision is specific in character and the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third country which is empowered to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of such data
in order to prevent unlawful access to non-personal data public sector bodies natural or legal persons to which the right to re-use data was granted data sharing providers and entities entered in the register of recognised data altruism organisations should take all reasonable measures to prevent access to the systems where non-personal data is stored including encryption of data or corporate policies
in order to build trust in re-use mechanisms it may be necessary to attach stricter conditions for certain types of non-personal data that have been identified as highly sensitive as regards the transfer to third countries if such transfer could jeopardise public policy objectives in line with international commitments for example in the health domain certain datasets held by actors in the public health system such as public hospitals could be identified as highly sensitive health data in order to ensure harmonised practices across the union such types of highly sensitive non-personal public data should be defined by union law for example in the context of the european health data space or other sectoral legislation the conditions attached to the transfer of such data to third countries should be laid down in delegated acts conditions should be proportionate non-discriminatory and necessary to protect legitimate public policy objectives identified such as the protection of public health public order safety the environment public morals consumer protection privacy and personal data protection the conditions should correspond to the risks identified in relation to the sensitivity of such data including in terms of the risk of the re-identification of individuals these conditions could include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements such as the requirement of using a secure processing environment limitations as regards the re-use of data in third-countries or categories of persons which are entitled to transfer such data to third countries or who can access the data in the third country in exceptional cases they could also include restrictions on transfer of the data to third countries to protect the public interest
public sector bodies should be able to charge fees for the re-use of data but should also be able to decide to make the data available at lower or no cost for example for certain categories of re-uses such as non-commercial re-use or re-use by small and medium-sized enterprises so as to incentivise such re-use in order to stimulate research and innovation and support companies that are an important source of innovation and typically find it more difficult to collect relevant data themselves in line with state aid rules such fees should be reasonable transparent published online and non-discriminatory
in order to incentivise the re-use of these categories of data member states should establish a single information point to act as the primary interface for re-users that seek to re-use such data held by the public sector bodies it should have a cross-sector remit and should complement if necessary arrangements at the sectoral level in addition member states should designate establish or facilitate the establishment of competent bodies to support the activities of public sector bodies allowing re-use of certain categories of protected data their tasks may include granting access to data where mandated in sectoral union or member states legislation those competent bodies should provide support to public sector bodies with state-of-the-art techniques including secure data processing environments which allow data analysis in a manner that preserves the privacy of the information such support structure could support the data holders with management of the consent including consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research data processing should be performed under the responsibility of the public sector body responsible for the register containing the data who remains a data controller in the sense of regulation eu insofar as personal data are concerned member states may have in place one or several competent bodies which could act in different sectors
providers of data sharing services data intermediaries are expected to play a key role in the data economy as a tool to facilitate the aggregation and exchange of substantial amounts of relevant data data intermediaries offering services that connect the different actors have the potential to contribute to the efficient pooling of data as well as to the facilitation of bilateral data sharing specialised data intermediaries that are independent from both data holders and data users can have a facilitating role in the emergence of new data-driven ecosystems independent from any player with a significant degree of market power this regulation should only cover providers of data sharing services that have as a main objective the establishment of a business a legal and potentially also technical relation between data holders including data subjects on the one hand and potential users on the other hand and assist both parties in a transaction of data assets between the two it should only cover services aiming at intermediating between an indefinite number of data holders and data users excluding data sharing services that are meant to be used by a closed group of data holders and users providers of cloud services should be excluded as well as service providers that obtain data from data holders aggregate enrich or transform the data and licence the use of the resulting data to data users without establishing a direct relationship between data holders and data users for example advertisement or data brokers data consultancies providers of data products resulting from value added to the data by the service provider at the same time data sharing service providers should be allowed to make adaptations to the data exchanged to the extent that this improves the usability of the data by the data user where the data user desires this such as to convert it into specific formats in addition services that focus on the intermediation of content in particular on copyright-protected content should not be covered by this regulation data exchange platforms that are exclusively used by one data holder in order to enable the use of data they hold as well as platforms developed in the context of objects and devices connected to the internet-of-things that have as their main objective to ensure functionalities of the connected object or device and allow value added services should not be covered by this regulation consolidated tape providersâ€™ in the sense of article  point of directive eu of the european parliament and of the council as well as account information service providersâ€™ in the sense of article point of directive eu of the european parliament and of the council should not be considered as data sharing service providers for the purposes of this regulation entities which restrict their activities to facilitating use of data made available on the basis of data altruism and that operate on a not-for-profit basis should not be covered by chapter iii of this regulation as this activity serves objectives of general interest by increasing the volume of data available for such purposes
a specific category of data intermediaries includes providers of data sharing services that offer their services to data subjects in the sense of regulation eu such providers focus exclusively on personal data and seek to enhance individual agency and the individualsâ€™ control over the data pertaining to them they would assist individuals in exercising their rights under regulation eu in particular managing their consent to data processing the right of access to their own data the right to the rectification of inaccurate personal data the right of erasure or right to be forgottenâ€™ the right to restrict processing and the data portability right which allows data subjects to move their personal data from one controller to the other in this context it is important that their business model ensures that there are no misaligned incentives that encourage individuals to make more data available for processing than what is in the individualsâ€™ own interest this could include advising individuals on uses of their data they could allow and making due diligence checks on data users before allowing them to contact data subjects in order to avoid fraudulent practices in certain situations it could be desirable to collate actual data within a personal data storage space or personal data spaceâ€™ so that processing can happen within that space without personal data being transmitted to third parties in order to maximise the protection of personal data and privacy
data cooperatives seek to strengthen the position of individuals in making informed choices before consenting to data use influencing the terms and conditions of data user organisations attached to data use or potentially solving disputes between members of a group on how data can be used when such data pertain to several data subjects within that group in this context it is important to acknowledge that the rights under regulation eu can only be exercised by each individual and cannot be conferred or delegated to a data cooperative data cooperatives could also provide a useful means for one-person companies micro small and medium-sized enterprises that in terms of knowledge of data sharing are often comparable to individuals
in order to increase trust in such data sharing services in particular related to the use of data and the compliance with the conditions imposed by data holders it is necessary to create a union-level regulatory framework which would set out highly harmonised requirements related to the trustworthy provision of such data sharing services this will contribute to ensuring that data holders and data users have better control over the access to and use of their data in accordance with union law both in situations where data sharing occurs in a business-to-business context and where it occurs in a business-to-consumer context data sharing providers should offer a novel europeanâ€™ way of data governance by providing a separation in the data economy between data provision intermediation and use providers of data sharing services may also make available specific technical infrastructure for the interconnection of data holders and data users
a key element to bring trust and more control for data holder and data users in data sharing services is the neutrality of data sharing service providers as regards the data exchanged between data holders and data users it is therefore necessary that data sharing service providers act only as intermediaries in the transactions and do not use the data exchanged for any other purpose this will also require structural separation between the data sharing service and any other services provided so as to avoid issues of conflict of interest this means that the data sharing service should be provided through a legal entity that is separate from the other activities of that data sharing provider data sharing providers that intermediate the exchange of data between individuals as data holders and legal persons should in addition bear fiduciary duty towards the individuals to ensure that they act in the best interest of the data holders
in order to ensure the compliance of the providers of data sharing services with the conditions set out in this regulation such providers should have a place of establishment in the union alternatively where a provider of data sharing services not established in the union offers services within the union it should designate a representative designation of a representative is necessary given that such providers of data sharing services handle personal data as well as commercially confidential data which necessitates the close monitoring of the compliance of such service providers with the conditions laid out in this regulation in order to determine whether such a provider of data sharing services is offering services within the union it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the provider of data sharing services is planning to offer services to persons in one or more member states the mere accessibility in the union of the website or of an email address and of other contact details of the provider of data sharing services or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the provider of data sharing services is established should be considered insufficient to ascertain such an intention however factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more member states with the possibility of ordering services in that other language or the mentioning of users who are in the union may make it apparent that the provider of data sharing services is planning to offer services within the union the representative should act on behalf of the provider of data sharing services and it should be possible for competent authorities to contact the representative the representative should be designated by a written mandate of the provider of data sharing services to act on the latters behalf with regard to the latters obligations under this regulation
this regulation should be without prejudice to the obligation of providers of data sharing services to comply with regulation eu and the responsibility of supervisory authorities to ensure compliance with that regulation where the data sharing service providers are data controllers or processors in the sense of regulation eu they are bound by the rules of that regulation this regulation should be also without prejudice to the application of competition law
providers of data sharing services should also take measures to ensure compliance with competition law data sharing may generate various types of efficiencies but may also lead to restrictions of competition in particular where it includes the sharing of competitively sensitive information this applies in particular in situations where data sharing enables businesses to become aware of market strategies of their actual or potential competitors competitively sensitive information typically includes information on future prices production costs quantities turnovers sales or capacities
a notification procedure for data sharing services should be established in order to ensure a data governance within the union based on trustworthy exchange of data the benefits of a trustworthy environment would be best achieved by imposing a number of requirements for the provision of data sharing services but without requiring any explicit decision or administrative act by the competent authority for the provision of such services
in order to support effective cross-border provision of services the data sharing provider should be requested to send a notification only to the designated competent authority from the member state where its main establishment is located or where its legal representative is located such a notification should not entail more than a mere declaration of the intention to provide such services and should be completed only by the information set out in this regulation
the main establishment of a provider of data sharing services in the union should be the member state with the place of its central administration in the union the main establishment of a provider of data sharing services in the union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities
the competent authorities designated to monitor compliance of data sharing services with the requirements in this regulation should be chosen on the basis of their capacity and expertise regarding horizontal or sectoral data sharing and they should be independent as well as transparent and impartial in the exercise of their tasks member states should notify the commission of the identity of the designated competent authorities
the notification framework laid down in this regulation should be without prejudice to specific additional rules for the provision of data sharing services applicable by means of sector-specific legislation
there is a strong potential in the use of data made available voluntarily by data subjects based on their consent or where it concerns non-personal data made available by legal persons for purposes of general interest such purposes would include healthcare combating climate change improving mobility facilitating the establishment of official statistics or improving the provision of public services support to scientific research including for example technological development and demonstration fundamental research applied research and privately funded research should be considered as well purposes of general interest this regulation aims at contributing to the emergence of pools of data made available on the basis of data altruism that have a sufficient size in order to enable data analytics and machine learning including across borders in the union
legal entities that seek to support purposes of general interest by making available relevant data based on data altruism at scale and meet certain requirements should be able to register as data altruism organisations recognised in the unionâ€™ this could lead to the establishment of data repositories as registration in a member state would be valid across the union and this should facilitate cross-border data use within the union and the emergence of data pools covering several member states data subjects in this respect would consent to specific purposes of data processing but could also consent to data processing in certain areas of research or parts of research projects as it is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection legal persons could give permission to the processing of their non-personal data for a range of purposes not defined at the moment of giving the permission the voluntary compliance of such registered entities with a set of requirements should bring trust that the data made available on altruistic purposes is serving a general interest purpose such trust should result in particular from a place of establishment within the union as well as from the requirement that registered entities have a not-for-profit character from transparency requirements and from specific safeguards in place to protect rights and interests of data subjects and companies further safeguards should include making it possible to process relevant data within a secure processing environment operated by the registered entity oversight mechanisms such as ethics councils or boards to ensure that the data controller maintains high standards of scientific ethics effective technical means to withdraw or modify consent at any moment based on the information obligations of data processors under regulation eu as well as means for data subjects to stay informed about the use of data they made available
this regulation is without prejudice to the establishment organisation and functioning of entities that seek to engage in data altruism pursuant to national law it builds on national law requirements to operate lawfully in a member state as a not-for-profit organisation entities which meet the requirements in this regulation should be able to use the title of data altruism organisations recognised in the unionâ€™
data altruism organisations recognised in the union should be able to collect relevant data directly from natural and legal persons or to process data collected by others typically data altruism would rely on consent of data subjects in the sense of article a and a and in compliance with requirements for lawful consent in accordance with article of regulation eu in accordance with regulation eu scientific research purposes can be supported by consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research or only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects article b of regulation eu specifies that further processing for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should in accordance with article of regulation eu not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes
to bring additional legal certainty to granting and withdrawing of consent in particular in the context of scientific research and statistical use of data made available on an altruistic basis a european data altruism consent form should be developed and used in the context of altruistic data sharing such a form should contribute to additional transparency for data subjects that their data will be accessed and used in accordance with their consent and also in full compliance with the data protection rules it could also be used to streamline data altruism performed by companies and provide a mechanism allowing such companies to withdraw their permission to use the data in order to take into account the specificities of individual sectors including from a data protection perspective there should be a possibility for sectoral adjustments of the european data altruism consent form
in order to successfully implement the data governance framework a european data innovation board should be established in the form of an expert group the board should consist of representatives of the member states the commission and representatives of relevant data spaces and specific sectors such as health agriculture transport and statistics the european data protection board should be invited to appoint a representative to the european data innovation board
the board should support the commission in coordinating national practices and policies on the topics covered by this regulation and in supporting cross-sector data use by adhering to the european interoperability framework eif principles and through the utilisation of standards and specifications such as the core vocabularies and the cef building blocks  without prejudice to standardisation work taking place in specific sectors or domains work on technical standardisation may include the identification of priorities for the development of standards and establishing and maintaining a set of technical and legal standards for transmitting data between two processing environments that allows data spaces to be organised without making recourse to an intermediary the board should cooperate with sectoral bodies networks or expert groups or other cross-sectoral organisations dealing with re-use of data regarding data altruism the board should assist the commission in the development of the data altruism consent form in consultation with the european data protection board
in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the commission to develop the european data altruism consent form those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation eu no of the european parliament and of the council 
in order to take account of the specific nature of certain categories of data the power to adopt acts in accordance with article tfeu should be delegated to the commission to lay down special conditions applicable for transfers to third-countries of certain non-personal data categories deemed to be highly sensitive in specific union acts adopted though a legislative procedure it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement of april on better law-making in particular to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member statesâ€™ experts and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts
this regulation should not affect the application of the rules on competition and in particular articles and of the treaty on the functioning of the european union the measures provided for in this regulation should not be used to restrict competition in a manner contrary to the treaty on the functioning of the european union this concerns in particular the rules on the exchange of competitively sensitive information between actual or potential competitors through data sharing services
the european data protection supervisor and the european data protection board were consulted in accordance with article of regulation eu of the european parliament and of the council  and delivered an opinion on [â€¦]
this regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter including the right to privacy the protection of personal data the freedom to conduct a business the right to property and the integration of persons with disabilities
