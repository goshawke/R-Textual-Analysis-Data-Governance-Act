# R-Textual-Analysis-Data-Governance-Act

The goal of this project is to analyze the 2022 EU Proposal for the Data Governance Act (DGA) for modal verb usage.

The modal verbs being analyzed are: "can", "cannot", "could", "may", "must", "should", "shall", "would", "need(s) to", and all forms of "be able to".

Modal verb usage is analyzed for the entire document and, separately, for each of 3 sections for the document.

This task involved cleaning of the document to remove formatting and unecessary characters and words. 

The end product was a series of tables and word clouds to provide insight about modal verb usage.
